## Formal Stage

- Stage: 3 — Direct Message / Outbound
- Status: `ready_to_start`
- Sealed: `false`

## Current Work

- ID: `WI-2026-09-response-latency-ux-architecture`
- Kind: `runtime_experience_architecture`
- Status: `latency_v1_phase2_context_compaction`
- Objective: Redesign XiaoU for low true latency and low perceived latency: simple turns should finish quickly; long work should acknowledge quickly, continue safely in the background, and deliver a truthful final result later.
- Blocker: Current production has latency telemetry but no current baseline decomposition by turn class, and the user-visible response policy does not separate first-visible response from final task completion.
- Next: Build and isolate-test a reversible Hermes-native long-session compaction candidate for Agnes 3.0. Target the observed >=24k latency cliff while preserving model-led reasoning, recent verbatim turns, semantic summary/recovery, trusted identity/authority context and full historical recoverability.
