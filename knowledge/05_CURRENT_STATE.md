## Formal Stage

- Stage: 3 — Direct Message / Outbound
- Status: `ready_to_start`
- Sealed: `false`

## Current Work

- ID: `WI-2026-09-response-latency-ux-architecture`
- Kind: `runtime_experience_architecture`
- Status: `latency_v1_phase3b_optional_schema_retry`
- Objective: Redesign XiaoU for low true latency and low perceived latency: simple turns should finish quickly; long work should acknowledge quickly, continue safely in the background, and deliver a truthful final result later.
- Blocker: Current production has latency telemetry but no current baseline decomposition by turn class, and the user-visible response policy does not separate first-visible response from final task completion.
- Next: Isolate-test PR #30 as the final V1 corrective-retry fix. If PASS, merge to main, assemble the V1 candidate release from phases 1-3, then perform Owner real WeCom speed+quality acceptance before production promotion.
